def format_percent_string(obj, escapes, fmt):
    """ Format an object using a formatting string

    Args:
        obj:        an object with attributes to format and methods to format
                    them
        escapes:    a mapping whose keys are single characters
        fmt:        a string specifying how to format the object

    Returns:
        A formatted string

    If fmt does not contain '%', returns fmt.

    The formatting string (fmt) may contain escape sequences of the form:

    %[<flag>]<option>

    where <flag> is a key in escapes with value None and <option> is a key in
    escapes whose value is a string. The string is a method name in obj.
    The method will be called with a single parameter (the escape sequence)
    and the returned string from the object method will replace the escape
    sequence in the returned string from this function.

    '%%' will be replaced by a single '%'

    The effect of unrecognized escape sequences (not in escapes) is undefined.

    If fmt contains a hash ('#'), the hash and everything after it will not be
    processed as above, but will instead be appended to the escape string
    whenever a method in obj is called as above.
