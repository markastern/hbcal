DATES
        The date to be converted comprises three integers: date (of month),
        month and year. If only two values are provided, the current year
        is used. If only one value is provided, the current month and year
        are used. If no value is provided, the current date is used.

        Negative dates can be used to count back from the end of the month
        e.g. use date=-1 for the last day of the month. Similarly, negative
        months can be used for the last month of the year.

CALENDARS

        All the calendars are assumed to extrapolate back to the creation of
        the world, except Daf Yomi which extrapolates back to the start of the
        first Daf Yomi cycle. Calendars specified on the command line and in
        the configuration file may be specified in mixed case and may be
        abbreviated.

        Zero or more output calendars may be specified. At most one of
        'civil', 'julian', 'gregorian' may be specified.

        The following calendars are supported:

    julian: The Julian Calendar

        The Julian calendar has a leap year (February has 29 days) every 4
        years (when the year is divisible by 4). The months are:

{civil_months}

    gregorian: The Gregorian calendar

        The Gregorian calendar has a leap year (February has 29 days) every 4
        years (when the year is divisible by 4), except when the year is
        divisble by 100 but not 400. For example, 1800 and 1900 were not leap
        years but 2000 was a leap year. The months are the same as for the
        Julian calendar.

    civil: The civil calendar

        The civil calendar is the calendar as used in England. The calendar
        changed from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in September 1752.
        There was then a difference of 11 days between the calendars, so the
        date jumped from 2nd September (Julian) to 14th September (Gregorian).
        The months are the same as for the Julian calendar.

    hebrew: The Hebrew calendar

        The Hebrew calendar has 12 or 13 months in a year. The months are:

{hebrew_months}

        The above numbering complies with Exodus 12 v2, and also ensures that
        months have consistent numbers. However, the year starts with {Tishri:{fmt}}.
        Month 13 is always accepted as valid, but is converted to {Adar Rishon:{fmt}}
        in a year with 12 months. Similarly, the 30th of {Cheshvan:{fmt}}, which
        sometimes has 29 days and sometimes has 30 days, is converted to the
        1st of {Kislev:{fmt}} in a year in which {Cheshvan:{fmt}} has 29 days. The 30th of
        {Kislev:{fmt}}, which sometimes has 29 days and sometimes has 30 days, is
        converted to the 1st of {Teveth:{fmt}} in a year in which {Kislev:{fmt}} has 29 days.

        When used as the input calendar in conjunction with the current date,
        the date is assumed to start at 6pm local time.

    daf: The Daf Yomi calendar

        Months of the Daf Yomi calendar represent tractates of the Babylonian
        Talmud. They are numbered in hbcal as follows:

{tractates}

        {Kinnim:{fmt}}, {Tamid:{fmt}} and {Middos:{fmt}} are considered to be parts of tractate {Meilah:{fmt}}.

        Years of the Daf Yomi calendar represent Daf Yomi cycles.

        Starting from the 8th cycle of Daf Yomi, a different edition of
        {Shekalim:{fmt}} is used, with 21 daf instead of 12.

        When used as the input calendar in conjunction with the current date,
        the date is assumed to start at 6pm local time if dafbind is set to
        'hebrew'.

OUTPUT FORMATS FOR HEBREW

        Output formats specified on the command line and in the configuration
        file may be specified in mixed case and may be abbreviated. They are
        used for output of Hebrew only. The following output formats are
        supported.

    Normal

        This is the default output format. Hebrew text is output as UTF-8
        from right to left. This only works correctly if the terminal emulator
        being used supports bi-directional output.

    Reverse

        Hebrew text is output as UTF-8 from left to right. This output format
        should be used with a terminal emulator that does not support
        bi-directional output.

    Phonetics

        Hebrew words are translated to English. If no equivalent English
        exists, they are transliterated.

    HTML

        Hebrew characters are output as HTML codes for UTF-8 characters from
        right to left. This is intended for use on web pages.

SEDRAH

        If the sedrah parameter is set, the current weekly sedrah is also
        output. This is usually the weekly portion read on the current or
        next shabbat, except if that shabbat is a festival or if Simchat
        Torah occurs midweek. The sedrah output is for the disapora (default)
        unless the israel parameter is set.

MOLAD

        If the molad parameter is set, the molad (mean lunar conjunction) for
        the hebrew month containing the input date is output according to all
        the calendars defined by the output calendar parameter. In this case,
        the input date itself is not output.

OMER

        If the omer parameter is set, the date of the omer is also output,
        provided that the date is between pesach and shavuot. If the date is
        outside this range, the parameter is ignored without an error.

CONFIGURATION FILE

        The location of the optional configuration file is '.hbcal.config' in
        the user's home directory. The file, if it exists, should be a
        standard INI file. It can contain the following sections:

    hbcal

        This section contains defaults for the command line options. Command
        line parameters will always override settings in the
        configuration file. Parameter values can be mixed case and can be
        abbreviated. The following parameters are accepted:

        input calendar

            Equivalent to --input on the command line

        output calendar

            Equivalent to --output on the command line

            Equivalent to --dafbind on the command line

        format

            Equivalent to --format on the command line

        sedrah

            Allowed values are:
                'true', 'yes' (equivalent to --sedrah on the command line)
                'false', 'no' (equivalent to --nosedrah on the command line)

        omer

            Allowed values are:
                'true', 'yes' (equivalent to --omer on the command line)
                'false', 'no' (equivalent to --noomer on the command line)

        molad

            Allowed values are:
                'true', 'yes' (equivalent to --molad on the command line)
                'false', 'no' (equivalent to --nomolad on the command line)

        israel

            Allowed values are:
                'true', 'yes' (equivalent to --israel on the command line)
                'false', 'no' (equivalent to --noisrael on the command line)
